## UI Navigation Guide

The frontend is a single-page React app served at `http://localhost:5173`. The sidebar has three sections: **Core**, **Intelligence**, and **Settings**.

---

### Layer 1 — Command Center (`/`)

**The Agentic Chat Interface.** This is the primary entry point for all workflows.

**How to use:**
1. Type a natural language prompt in the chat input at the bottom, e.g.:
   - `"Find VP of Marketing prospects using HubSpot"`
   - `"Show me uncontacted leads in the US with a tech company"`
   - `"Build a call list of C-suite prospects at Series B companies"`
2. The **Gemini NLQ Orchestrator** processes the prompt, shows a real-time reasoning log (chain-of-thought steps), and returns a filtered **Playlist** of matching prospects.
3. Two actions from the result card:
   - **Execute Operations** → navigates directly to `/dialer` with the generated playlist pre-loaded.
   - **Save Playlist** → saves the list to the sidebar for later use.
4. **Saved Lists** appear in the left sidebar of the Command Center. Click any list to enter **List Editor Mode** — you can rename it, edit the description, and remove individual prospects.
5. Click **Enrich Database** (top of chat) to run a simulated ZoomInfo-style enrichment pass that fills in missing tech stack and title fields.

**Layer 1 → Layer 3 Progression:**
```
Type prompt → AI reasons → Playlist generated → Click "Execute Operations" → Power Dialer (Layer 3)
```

---

### Layer 3 — Power Dialer (`/dialer`)

**The Task Execution Engine.** A 3-pane split layout for working through a call playlist.

**Panes:**
- **Left Rail (Queue):** Full ordered list of prospects. Completed calls are faded with a ✓. The active prospect is highlighted in indigo.
- **Center Pane (Context & Script):** Shows the prospect's name, company, email, and a dynamically generated AI Info Brief + call script.
- **Right Pane (Call Controls):** Dial button, call status indicator, and disposition logging.

**Workflow:**
1. Arrive here from the Command Center (playlist auto-loaded) or directly (falls back to all prospects).
2. Click **Dial** to initiate a simulated MS Teams PSTN call via the backend WebSocket.
3. The status transitions: `IDLE → DIALING → CONNECTED` — driven by the backend via WebSocket push.
4. When a call connects, a timer starts. Click **Hang Up** to enter wrap-up.
5. Select a disposition (Connected, Voicemail, No Answer, Callback) to log the outcome.
6. **Auto-Advance:** The queue automatically moves to the next prospect. Toggle **Auto-Dial** to continuously dial without manual triggers.
7. When all prospects are processed: "Playlist Complete" screen is shown.

---

### Sequences (`/sequence-manager`)

**Email sequence builder with step-by-step template editor.**

**Left Pane:** List of all sequences. Click **+ New Sequence** to create one. Click any sequence name to select it.

**Right Pane (Tabs):**
- **Steps tab:** View, add, edit, and reorder email steps. Each step has: Order, Delay Days (send after X days), Subject Template, Body Template. Use `{{firstName}}`, `{{company}}` merge tags.

### Review Queue — HITL (`/hitl`)

**Human-in-the-Loop oversight interface.** Every AI action below 85% confidence is routed here before execution.

**Three-pane layout:**

**Left Rail (Review Queue):**
- Shows all pending AI-generated actions (email drafts, call scripts).
- Each item shows: prospect name, company, action type, urgency, pipeline value, and a **confidence score bar** (Green >85%, Yellow 70-84%, Red <70%).

  - **✎ Accept Edited Version** — (visible when editing) approves your modified version.
  - **✗ Reject** — blocks the action.
  - **↑ Escalate** — raises priority and flags for supervisor.

**Action Log:** At the bottom of the left rail, a running log of all completed decisions in this session.

### Integrations (`/integrations`)

**Connect email and telephony providers.**

**Google Workspace:** Enter your OAuth2 Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token. The backend performs a live token validation against Google's OAuth server before saving.
